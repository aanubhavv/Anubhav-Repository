# Decentralized Voting Application

This is a demo application to implement voting in solidity smart contract using ReactJS. 

## Installation

After you cloned the repository, you want to install the packages using

```shell
npm install
```

You first need to compile the contract and upload it to the blockchain network using Remix IDE.

Once the contract is uploaded to the blockchain, copy the contract address and contract ABI then paste it in the constant.js file.

Once you have pasted your ABI and contract address in the constant.js file, simply run command

```shell
npm start
```

ensure that your Metamask wallet remains connected to the same blockchain network on which the contract was deployed.
